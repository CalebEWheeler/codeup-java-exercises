    //=================================     KNOWLEDGE     =========================================//
    //* I can explain how Java code runs: from being written to executing on an operating system.
    //    Programmer>writes code to .java file>input from file to compiler>output from compiler to
    //    .class file>.class file runs on JVM(java virtual machine)>JVM runs on OS.
    //* I can explain the difference between a primitive type and a reference type in Java.
    //    A primitive type is a data type that is a value
    //    A reference type refer to an object or an array(they have a default value of "null"
    //* I can name several primitive types in Java.
    //    - byte
    //    - short
    //    - int
    //    - long
    //    - float
    //    - double
    //    - char
    //    - boolean
    //* I can explain why multiple number primitive types are used.
    //    multiple number primitive types are used to allow the programmer
    //    to utilize less storage space when writing code
    //* I can give an example of implicit and explicit casting.

    //* I can explain the difference between a runtime and compile-time error.
    //
    //* I can identify the major editions of Java.
    //
    //* I can define what a Java wrapper class is.



    //===================================     SKILLS     ==========================================//
    //* I can write a hello world Java program from scratch.

    //* I can write Java control statements (if, if/else, switch, ternary) and loops (while, do-while, for, for-each) from memory.

    //* I can write examples of the 8 Java primitive types.

    //* I can write examples of explicit casting and implicit casting.

    //* I can convert a numeric string to a number and a number to a numeric string.

    //* I can define a constant.

    //* I can write a program that takes in user input and returns an output to the user.

    //* I can compare two string values.

    //* I can write out a program comprised of multiple methods.

    //* I can get the length of string, trim it, get a portion of the string, create a new string replacing some portion of it.
