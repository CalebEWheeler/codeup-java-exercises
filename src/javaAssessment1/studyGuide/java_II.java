    //=================================     KNOWLEDGE     =========================================//
    //* I can articulate what OOP is.
    //      creating objects that contain both data and methods
    //* I can identify the four levels of visibility for a class/field/method and the identifiers used.
    //      - public (accessible everywhere)
    //      - private (only accessible within the class that defines it)
    //      - protected (accessible everywhere besides outside of a project)
    //      - no modifier (package private) - accessible within the same package
    //* I know what class of static methods is often used when working with arrays.
    //      you want an array to be static so it belongs to a class and can be accessed through the class
    //* I can explain the difference between static (class) fields/methods and instance fields/methods.
    //      - instance methods allow you to create instance objects with different values for
    //          their instance fields
    //      - static methods belong to a class as a whole, they are accessible through the class
    //          itself, without creating an instance of the class ex: Math.PI || Math.floor()
    //* I can explain the difference between method overloading and method overriding.
    //      - method overloading is creating another method with the same name, but passing different
    //          parameters
    //      - method overriding allows subclasses to define a method with the same name, return type,
    //          and parameters as in the superclass. Allows the subclass to provide it's own
    //          implementation of a method
    //* I can identify the four pillars of object-oriented programming and give examples of each one.
    //
    //* I can describe the differences between interfaces and abstract classes and their use cases.
    //
    //* I can generally describe what the Java Collections Framework is and specifically
    //      talk about the differences between a list, set, and map.
    //
    //* I can explain the difference between a checked and unchecked exception.
    //
    //* I can explain what a Java annotation is, why they are used, and give examples.
    //
    //* I can explain the difference between the throws and throw keywords with regard to exceptions.
    //

    //===================================     SKILLS     ==========================================//
    //* I can write a class that contains both static and instance fields and
    //      methods, constructors, setters and getters.

    //* I can write a program composed of multiple classes requiring instantiation
    //      (not just using classes as groups of static methods).

    //* I can write my own reference type and fill instances of it in an ArrayList and
    //      HashMap and use it as a return and input type of a method.

    //* I can write an abstract class and a subclass that extends from the abstract class.

    //* I can write multiple interfaces and implement their methods in another class.

    //* I can create arrays of various data types and sizes with and without using an array initializer.

    //* I can get the length of an array, get a specific element or range of elements,
    //      create a new array replacing some portion of it, and iterate over an array of elements.

    //* I can do the above with an ArrayList.

    //* I can comfortably use the helper methods of both Arrays and Collections classes.

    //* I can write a program that throws a runtime exception.

    //* I can write an example of method overloading and method overriding.

    //* I can write a program that reads and writes to a file.

    //* I can write methods and collections that work with a parent class or interface type
    //      but use instances of objects that extend from these parent classes or implement
    //      these interfaces (Polymorphism).
